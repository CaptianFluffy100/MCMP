# GLADOS Start Guide

This is a basic startup guide for GLADOS.

## About

GLADOS is a program that runs on a server to connect serveral Minecraft servers together with portals.  The mod needed to do this is MCMP (Minecraft Multiverse Portal) mod.  This mod sits on the Minecraft server.

You use GLADOS to set portal definitions that when built and then lite will create a portal instance which you can then set the instance to linkup with another portal instance.  You can have inter-server connections and outer-server connections.

Inter-server connections will teleport you from one portal to another on the save MC server.  Outer-server connections will transfore player data between servers and then move the player to the new server to the portals position.

## Edit server

This page alows you to edit server info.  IP, Port and Name. And delete the server.

The Minecraft Server can make these edits as well.

## Edit Portal Definitions

This page alows you to edit portal definitions.  Build block, light with item, colors (r,g,b).  You can add and delete portal defs from this page.

This defines what a portal is to the servers so the server knows what is a portal, and what is not a portal.  It will also set the portal color for more customization.
